ex1.) When the value of count becomes 7 or 15, the continue statement plays its role and skip their execution but for other values of the count, the loop will run smoothly.
consider  i =20
solution
public class java1
{
public static void main (string []args) 
  {
    for(int i=0;i<=20;i++) 
    {
      if(i==7 || i==15 ) 
      {
      continue;
      }
     system.out.println("i= "+i);
    }
  }
}
